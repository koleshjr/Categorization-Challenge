Credrails is an open banking platform that allows anyone to access data from banks, mobile money and offline transactions through an API, to build applications. Many such applications are used for analytics, which rely on insights from the bank transaction.

The aim of this challenge is to categorise banking transactions into categories and subcategories. Being able to categorise the transactions for any bank statement will help us create a categorisation model that can categorise any transaction on our platform and provide world-class analytics to our customers.
